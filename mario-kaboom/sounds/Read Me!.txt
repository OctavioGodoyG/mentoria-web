I recently saw a video from JD3 with Mario, and you could hear the 8 Bit theme put together with the 16 Bit one.
So I just had to make this. The difficulty was to sync the rythms, what was quite hard actually.

Includes:
* Mono
* Stereo 1 (8 Bit is left)
* Stereo 2 (16 Bit is left)

My favourite one is Stereo 2 - Check it out!
